      "1": "On December 29, 2015, a core group of six friends got together and founded Chartreuse Gaming, as an association under the law of 1901. Unanimous, they wish to seize the opportunity to take part in the eSport boom by becoming local actors of the rural environment and the Rhône-Alpes region. Thus, they take as their leitmotiv the organization of physical events and online events.",
      "2": "It is only on October 28, 2017, that the first edition of its flagship event is born: the Chartreuse Esport Contest (CEC#1). After encouraging signs, the association wishes to annualize the event and make it grow until obtaining a national influence.",
      "3": "With no less than thirty volunteers and after a period troubled by the health crisis, the association takes the bet of a physical event while the other organizations prefer to dematerialize their event. It was then that Chartreuse Gaming signed its most ambitious event with 98 players spread over League Of Legends, Counter Strike: Global Offensive and Rocket League, and a global prize of 3500€.",
      "4": "This last edition confirms the volunteers in their wish to impose themselves on the regional scene and then on the tricolour scene. In order to achieve this, the association decided to move to Saint-Martin-d'Hères, in the Grenoble metropolis."
